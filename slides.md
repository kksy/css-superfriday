Selector

The HTML element name at the start of the rule set. It selects the element(s) to be styled (in this case, "p" elements). To style a different element, just change the selector.

Declaration

A single rule like color: red; specifying which of the element's properties you want to style.

Properties

Ways in which you can style a given HTML element. 

Property value

To the right of the property after the colon, we have the property value, which chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property (there are many color values besides red).
